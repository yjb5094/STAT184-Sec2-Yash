Intro:
In this assignment, we had to Transform the Armed Forces Activity Duty Data from a frequency (pivot) table into two data frames--one where a case is a group of soldiers and one where a case is an individual soldier.

Implementation:
To do so, we loaded the packages, scraped the pay grade and rank table,
wrangled the pay grade and rank table, 
loaded the armed forces data twice to get both the order of columns and the data without column headers,
wrangles the armed forces data
merged armed forces and pay grade and rank tables,
then used uncount to turn the groups into individual soldiers

Results:
In the end, we were able to transform the data into groups as well as individuals, here is an example of the output:
